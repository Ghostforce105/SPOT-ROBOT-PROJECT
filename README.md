Project Title:

Development of a Quadruped Robot with Sensor Integration and AI-based Object Detection

Project Description:

This project involves the design and development of a quadruped robot (SPOT-like) using SolidWorks for mechanical modeling and ESP32 microcontroller for sensor interfacing and real-time control. The robotic system integrates multiple sensors for environmental awareness and motion stability, including:

Temperature Sensor – for monitoring thermal conditions and preventing overheating.

IMU (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer) – for measuring orientation, acceleration, angular velocity, and heading to maintain stability and balance during locomotion.

Pressure Sensors – mounted on the robot’s feet to detect ground contact and distribute weight efficiently.

The robot’s control system is powered by ESP32, which provides Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity for remote control and data transmission. The robot’s gait planning and motion control algorithms ensure smooth walking and obstacle negotiation.

Additionally, an AI-based object detection system is integrated using a computer vision model (e.g., YOLO, MobileNet, or TensorFlow Lite) deployed on an edge device or onboard processor. This enables the robot to detect, recognize, and respond to objects in its environment, making it capable of autonomous navigation in dynamic surroundings.

Key Features:

Mechanical Design: Fully modeled in SolidWorks with optimized structural components for stability and load distribution.

Microcontroller: ESP32 for high-speed processing and wireless communication.

Sensors: IMU (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer), Pressure Sensors, and Temperature Sensor for real-time feedback and safety.

AI System: Object detection using deep learning-based models integrated with the robot’s vision system.

Applications: Search and rescue, autonomous inspection, surveillance, and research in robotics and AI
