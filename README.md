# SPOT-ROBOT-PROJECT
This project involves the design and development of a quadruped robot (SPOT-like) using SolidWorks for mechanical modeling and ESP32 microcontroller for sensor interfacing and real-time control. The robotic system integrates multiple sensors for environmental awareness and motion stability.
